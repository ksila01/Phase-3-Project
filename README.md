# Phase 3 Project



## Project Overview
Our client, SyriaTel is a telecommunication company severe loss of valuable customers to its rivals. Understanding and predicting customer churn is essential in assessing the effectiveness of the company's marketing efforts to improve customer satisfaction. In the telecom sector, user acquisition and retention are the main issues. Every business's marketplace is expanding quickly, which is leading to a rise in the number of subscribers. As a result, businesses now understand how important it is to keep their current clientele. Service providers now need to lower their client turnover rate because neglecting to do so could hurt their business's profitability. Churn prediction helps to determine which customers are most likely to move from one organization to another.  The issue of the telecom industry's constantly rising churn rate persists. In light of this, the current study uses a big-data platform's machine-learning technique. These telecom companies can be protected with effective strategies for reducing the rate of attrition thanks to machine learning algorithm techniques.
### Business Problem
Since the telecommunications business is growing to be one of the largest in the world, competition has intensified due to advancements in technology and the growing number of operators. Telecommunication companies are striving to survive in this competitive industry, and strategies have been developed to generate substantial profits. Companies must reduce the likelihood of customer churn, often known as "the movement of customers from one service provider to another service provider," in order to increase customer retention.  In service industries where there is a rise in competitive services, customer attrition is regarded as a serious problem.
